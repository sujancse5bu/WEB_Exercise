# Community Modifiers

Due to bundle size and complexity constraints, we can't include all the possible
modifiers in the core library, but we do encourage everybody to publish their
own **custom modifiers** in dedicated npm packages!

When you do so, please make sure to add the `popperjs-modifier`
[keyword][npm-keyword] to your `package.json`, so that other people can easily
discover the community modifiers [on npm][npm-search-result].

You can find all the information needed to learn how to create your very own
custom modifiers by visiting [the dedicated docs](../#custom-modifiers).

Below you can find a few common examples to help get you started:

- [`maxSize` modifier][maxsize-sandbox]: changes the size of your popper to fit
  it within the available viewport space. (published as an [npm
  package][maxsize-npm])
- [`sameWidth` modifier][samewidth-sandbox]: make your popper the same width as
  the reference.
