Something about JavaScript:

1. nextSibling, preveousSigling returns undefined in some browser 
    if the html elements contains spaces or enter.

2. To set an eventListener in a parent element (like form, ul, table) 
    gives a better performance (EVENT DELEGATION), 
    because creating eventListeners for a lot of elements can slow down a page. 
    And event deligation would still work the same if new items are inseted 
    or deleted from the list or table data.
	
	
	
	
	
Something about jQuery:

1. Get and Set Information:
     GET >> If a jQuery selection holds more than one element,
	and a method is used to get information from the selected elements, 
	it will retrieve information from the first element in the matched set. (not the .text() method) ;(;
	 SET >> If a jQuery selecttion holds more than one element,
	and a method is used to update information on the page, 
	it will update all of the elements in the matched set, not just the first one.
2. $(function() {
       // script goes here
   });       
       >> A positive side effect of writing jQuery  code inside this method is that it
	   creates function-level scope for its variables. This prevents namimg collisions with other scripts 
	   might use the same variable name;
   It is commonly used inseted of 
   $(document).ready(function() {
       // script goes here
   )};

3. $('li').html() returns the first <li> element;
   $('li').text() returns the content of all <li> elements
   including spaces between words but no spaces between the individual list items;
   
4. To get content from <input> or <textarea> elements, have to use the .val() method.
